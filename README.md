# Ninja Game Jam 4
 A game created over the span of a week using the Unity Game Engine.

Lumberjack Legacy: Beyond the Wall is a top down 2D rogue-lite created in the Unity Game Engine. You play as a lumberjack who leaves the safety of the walled off city to go out into an ever changing forest, cutting down trees while avoiding the creatures of the forest. After you return from the forest, you go to the local shop to sell your wood to buy upgrades for your axe and your speed. Save enough money and win the game. The forest is procedurally generated every time you enter.

This project is a prototype, so it has a few bugs, and the code is messy. In the future, I plan on recreating this, and turning it into a full game. Below is a link to the Itch.io page, where the game build is available for download for windows, or playable in the browser.
